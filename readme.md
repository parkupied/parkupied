Team Contract

1. We can stay late but you're not obliged to.
2. We decide during standups if we're going to pair-program or work individually for that day.
3. If you're working outside of class, please slack on the channel to let us know what file are you working on.

MVP: 

React Native app that allows users to give up/ look for parking. A crowd-sourced parking map, which would map parkers with parking spots about to be given up, IF they have a parking token in their account. Each successful park due to the app will cost one parking token. Parking tokens can be gained by successfully giving up parking spots to parkers. There is a matching algorithm for closest proximity.
